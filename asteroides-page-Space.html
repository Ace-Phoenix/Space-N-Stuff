<h1 class = "asteroides">Asteroides</h1>
<h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>A small rocky body orbiting the sun. Larger numbers of these,ranging in size from 600 mils(1,000 km) across(ceres) to dust particles.</p>

  <p> This shows how Asteroides have a large number and they are all around us</p>

<p>Here is some simple fun facts</p>
<ul>
  <li>Current theory suggest that asteroids are planetisimals – the building blocks of planets – that were never incorporated into one of the eight planets in our solar system.</li>
  <li>An asteroid impact around 65 million years ago caused a chain reaction that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs and affected all life on Earth, according to scientists.</li>
  <li>Asteroids are similar to comets but do not have a visible coma (fuzzy outline and tail) like comets do.</li>
  <li>Asteroids are small Solar System bodies that orbit the Sun. Made of rock and metal, they can also contain organic compounds (some scientists suggest that asteroids could have brought they necessary chemicals to start life on Earth).</li>
</ul>
<h3> Small facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first asteroid was Ceres, discovered by Giuseppe Piazzi in 1801.</li>
<li>There are currently over 600,000 known asteroids in our solar system.</li>
<li>Asteroids are leftovers of the early Solar System.</li>
<li>Asteroids are made of different things.</li>
<li>Some asteroids have moons.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cool Facts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Most asteroids are found orbiting in the Asteroid Belt, a series of rings located between the orbits of Mars and Jupites.</li>
  <li>asteroids in the Solar System orbit the Sun in a band between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This band is commonly referred to as the Asteroid Belt.</li>
  <li>asteroids found in the Asoteroid Belt are the remnants of a planet that failed to form</li>
  <li>If all the material in the Asteroid Belt were to be combined, the resulting object’s diameter is projected to be at most about half that of Earth’s moon.</li>
  <li>A meteoroid (piece of asteroid) the size of a car falls into the Earth’s atmosphere on average once every year. This creates a bright fireball effect, but it usually burns up in the atmosphere before it reaches the ground.</li>
  </ul>
