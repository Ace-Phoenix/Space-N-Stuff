  <p>There is evidince of rocketry being used as early as 2,000 years ago but was inly realy used for military use untill the 18th century. after WW2, the Soviet Union and United States fought to grab as many German rocket scientests for there own space program. The USSR was able to get the first artificial satellite and man into space but the US got man on the moon first. The space race ended with the fall of the USSR in December 26, 1991. However, space exploration did not end there. Humans have worked together to get multiple spacecraft to mars, some past our solarsystem and one has landed on the surface of Venus.</p>
